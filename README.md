## Description
This project is about the development of a Rest API that allows users to add, edit and delete clothes and shoes from their closet. Each garment can have attributes such as name, category (shirt, pants, etc.), description...
<br><br>Each of these garments can be defined as visible or not visible, so that they are available or not available to be borrowed.
<br><br>By contacting friends through the application, it will be possible to see the garments that these friends are willing to share with the user.
